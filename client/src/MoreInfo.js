          A system that will manage the activities of a car rental was the primary objective of this 
          research study. With the implementation of the proposed car rental management system with 
          scheduling algorithm, the transaction of the business will become easy and reliable. The development 
          system will enable the users to effectively manage the transaction, scheduling and inventory of cars of 
          the car rental business. The researchers used Extreme Programming Methodology since this type of 
          software development methodology helped the researchers in the planning, designing, implementation 
          and maintenance of the developed system. Based on the results gathered from the respondents of the 
          study, the application gained a positive response on the criteria Speed and Graphical User Interface. It 
          was noticeable that the respondents were satisfied on the performance of the developed system and the 
          scheduling algorithm implemented in the system efficiently performed its desired operation. Based on 
          the information the researchers gathered, the developed application for car rental business with the 
          integration of scheduling algorithm was useful and appropriate solution to the identified problems by 
          the researchers.<br/><br/>
      The system manages the most important components of a car rental company through a modular network, which can be adapted to any country
       or size. It connects management of a fleet, people, and business, to make the operations as efficient as possible.<br/><br/>

        In 1993, National Car Rental faced liquidation. General Motors Corporation (National's parent) took a $744 million charge against 
      earnings related to its ownership of National Car Rental Systems. National faced liquidation, with the loss of 7,500 jobs, unless it 
      could show a profit in the short term. National initiated a comprehensive revenue management program whose core is a suite of analytic 
      models developed to manage capacity, pricing, and reservation. As it improved management of these functions, National dramatically
       increased its revenue. The initial implementation in July 1993 produced immediate results and returned National Car Rental to 
       profitability. In July 1994, National implemented a state-of-the-art revenue management system, improving revenues by $56 million 
       in the first year. In April 1995, General Motors sold National Car Rental Systems for an estimated $1.2 billion.<br/><br/>

            As man develops consciousness about the world, it is 
            undeniable that online transaction has become a 
            trend in transacting business today. It helps in 
            performing task in easy way real time. Some 
            companies have become fully automated while 
            others striving to setup them in automation. 
            Computer programmers develop things like 
            computer system that the rest of us could use.<br/><br/>


The advent of new technology gave rise to easy and 
            hassle-free interaction between and among humans. 
            Whether it is in business, science or whatever task a 
            person takes on the quality and speed of carrying it 
            out are enhanced with automation at the core of this 
            efficient. The developed system for Vista entitled 
            “Online Car Rental Reservation System”, a transaction 
            processing system is an example of automation.<br/><br/>

            
            

            Car rental business is becoming big, and competition 
            is getting high. Considering the success of online

      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

      <font size="+1">
        <p>
        Customers will be able to reserve their vehicles from anywhere in the world due to the Car Rental System. Consumers 
      provide information to this application by filling in their personal information. When a consumer creates an account on the 
      website, he or she can reserve a car. The proposed system is an online system that is fully integrated. It effectively and efficiently
      automates manual procedures. Customers are aided by this automated method, which allows them to fill in the specifics 
      according to their needs. It contains information on the sort of car they want to hire as well as the location. The goal of this 
      system is to create a website where customers can book their automobiles and request services from anywhere in the world. 
      There are three phases to this car rental system mentioned in the introduction.
      <br/><br/>



          The car management system with the integration of 
          scheduling algorithm provides several modules for 
          the administrator and users of the system. It allows 
          the booking of cars by the customers and the 
          business could easily schedule and manage the 
          request of the customers. The application also offers 
          the viewing of the available cars in a car rental 
          business. It has a transaction page where the 
          administrator of the system could easily check the 
          availability of the car and other information's needed 
          by the car rental business.
          
          With the car rental management system, the 
          administrator account can easily check the inventory 
          of the available cars and other credentials by visiting 
          the car inventory page of the application. A mark will 
          appear in the inventory panel for the non-available 
          cars and those which has low inventory
